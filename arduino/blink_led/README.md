# Blink LED with Arduino :pencil:

A basic program where we connect a LED and create a program to turn it on and off in intervals of one second

## Equipment :wrench:

- 1 x 400 point breadboard
- 1 x Arduino Uno
- 1 x 5mm LED
- 1 x 330 ohm resistors
- 2 x Jumper Wires
  
## Connections :electric_plug:
As you can see in the diagram the connections are simple
 
 1. Connect one **Jumper Wire to PIN 9**
 2. Connect the **330 ohms resistor between the Jumper wire and the
    Anode(+) of the LED**
 3. Connect with other **Jumper Wire the Cathode(-) of the LED and one GND
    PIN**

## Warning :warning:

**Be careful** when putting the **led** because **has polarity**
- The **long leg** of an LED indicates the **Anode (+)** :red_circle:
- The **short leg** of an LED indicates the **Cathode (-)** :black_circle:

**If the polarity is not respected the led will burn out** :boom:

## Challenges :star:

 - Make the LED blink faster/slower
 - Try to create the word SOS in Morse Code using the blinking LED
