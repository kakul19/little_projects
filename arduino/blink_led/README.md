# Blink LED  :pencil:

A basic program where we connect a LED and create a program to turn it on and off in intervals of one second.

# :one: Arduino Uno

In the first case we will use the **Arduino Uno**.

## Some info about it :page_with_curl:

**Arduino Uno** is a microcontroller board **based on** the **ATmega328P**. It has **14 digital input/output pins** (of which **6 can be used as PWM** outputs), **6 analog inputs**, a **USB connection**, a **power jack** and a **reset button.**

## Equipment :wrench:

- 1 x 400 point breadboard
- 1 x Arduino Uno
- 1 x 5mm LED
- 1 x 330 ohm resistors
- 2 x Jumper Wires

## Connections :electric_plug:

As you can see in the diagram the connections are simple

1. Connect one **Jumper Wire to PIN 9**
2. Connect the **330 ohms resistor between the Jumper wire and the
Anode(+) of the LED**
3. Connect with other **Jumper Wire the Cathode(-) of the LED and one GND
PIN**

## Warning :warning:

**Be careful** when putting the **led** because **has polarity**
- The **long leg** of an LED indicates the **Anode (+)** :red_circle:
- The **short leg** of an LED indicates the **Cathode (-)** :black_circle:

**If the polarity is not respected the led will burn out** :boom:

# :two: Arduino Nano

In the second case we will use an **Arduino NANO.**

## Some info about it :page_with_curl:

The **Arduino Nano** is a **small**, **complete**, and **breadboard-friendly** board **based on** the **ATmega328.** It has **14 digital input/output pins** (of which **6 can be used as PWM** outputs), **8 analog inputs** and a **Micro USB connection.**

## Equipment :wrench:

- 1 x 400 point breadboard
- 1 x Arduino Nano
- 1 x 5mm LED
- 1 x 330 ohm resistors
- 2 x Jumper Wires

## Connections :electric_plug:

As you can see in the diagram the connections are simple

1. Connect one **Jumper Wire to PIN 13**
2. Connect the **330 ohms resistor between the Jumper wire and the
Anode(+) of the LED**
3. Connect with other **Jumper Wire the Cathode(-) of the LED and one GND
PIN**

## Warning :warning:

Like in the first case **if the polarity is not respected the led will burn out** :boom:  so be careful please

Remember:
- The **long leg** of an LED indicates the **Anode (+)** :red_circle:
- The **short leg** of an LED indicates the **Cathode (-)** :black_circle:

# :star: Challenges :star:

 - Make the LED blink faster/slower
 -  Try to create the word SOS in Morse Code using the blinking LED
